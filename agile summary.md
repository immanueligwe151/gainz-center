#AGILE
For this project, I am using Agile methodology as a means of planning and tracking progress. This project would be run in Sprints of 10, with each sprint combining similar and related user stories, development and todo tasks. I will be using GitHub issues to create user stories, and I will be using GitHub milestones to create Sprints.

##Sprint 1
This sprint will be all about planning the project. This will include the creation of user stories, ERD diagram for the database, setup for the Django project and linking the database to the project, and UI design. This sprint has been set to be completed on the same day.

##Sprint 2
This sprint will be all about populating the database with preliminary data. I will be using a MySQL database with various neccesary tables following the ERD created from Sprint 1. This sprint has been set to be completed on the day after Sprint 1.

##Sprint 3
This sprint will be all about designing the bulk of the frontend HTML and CSS code, and any required JavaScript code required for basic frontend performance. The design will follow the planned frontend design done in Sprint 1, and will run concurrently with Sprint 2, aimed to be completed on the day after Sprint 2.

##Sprint 4
This sprint will be all about the designing of the backend. This will also run concurrently with Sprints 2 and 3, due to the overlapping nature of some of it. This is meant to be completed 2 days after Sprint 3

##Sprint 5
This sprint will be all about testing and fixing any errors in the code, as well as updating the README markdown. This is meant to be completed on the day after Sprint 4.

##Sprint 6
This sprint will be all about deployment to Heroku, meant to be completed on the day after Sprint 5.
